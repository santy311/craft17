After that, you\\u2019ll learn how to let users login with their email or Google account. You\\u2019ll then learn how to use Firebase\\u2019s Security and Rules language to secure and add permissions to your data.\\n\\n\\nIn the second lesson, you\\u2019ll learn about Firebase Storage, which lets users upload content from their devices. Then you\\u2019ll have a brief overview of Firebase Analytics so you can analyze app usage data to make decision about your app. Following that, you\\u2019ll explore Firebase Notifications, which allow you to send notifications to customized segments of users.  Finally, you\\u2019ll dive into Firebase Remote Config, which gives you the ability to tune and customize your app without having to publish a new version. By the end of this course you will have an Android application that can store and share data between different users in realtime as well as authenticate and authorize those users.', u'expected_duration': 2}\n"
